        <li>
          For the first 24 hours, do not get your lashes wet, do not use mascara
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Do not use waterproof mascara after the lift, this will affect the
          result
        </li>

        <li>
          Try not to sleep on your eyes, this can affect the result, the perm
          can still oxidize after.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not clean your eyes by brushing or rubbing, but try to clean with
          the lift, so up and down, so you keep a nice result and prevent the
          lashes from getting mixed up
        </li>
      </ol>
