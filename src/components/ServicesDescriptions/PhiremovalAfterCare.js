          First, use the A&D cream, this is to soothe the scabs & to improve
          healing. Then, 48 hours after the procedure, apply a thin layer of
          this cream on the area that was treated during the procedure. Apply
          the cream at least 2-3 times per day until the scabs come off & scab
          shedding is completed. This may take 7-14 days and even more.

          Anti-Scar gel (New Gel + advance silicone gel for scars) is applied
          after serious injuries, as a surgical intervention when tissue
          scarring is expected and for scar prevention. Apply this gel after the
          initial scab shedding. A small amount is enough, it is to be applied
          on the skin every 8 hrs. It should be applied every day until the skin
          relief is restored, redness disappears & the skin color in the area
          obtains the same color as surrounding tissues. The usual time is 30 or
          more days.
